# Configure MariaDB Ansible & Manually

# Early Opening
This is the configuration how to setup Mariadb Server and client on ubuntu server on AWS, GCP or in any cloud provider, I made this just for my documentation and if it is useful for others to use, that's great.

there are two configuration settings, namely using Ansible and Manually, if you want to setup with Ansible you can enter a folder with the name Ansible, Ansible is perfect for avoiding human error or misconfiguration, and the second one can be configured manually you can open the folder with the name Manually, manually this good for sparse configurations.

# How to use it ?
